In the near future we will introduce versioning, so expect this section to change.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: this might reveal the vulnerability.

Instead, you should use the form to [privately report a vulnerability to us via GitHub](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/security/advisories/new)
or email the maintainers directly at: [**security@ohmyz.sh**](mailto:security@ohmyz.sh).

We will deal with the vulnerability privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
